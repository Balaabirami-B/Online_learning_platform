jscode

function enroll(full stack development) {
    alert("You have enrolled in " + frontend + "!");
}

function login(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const email = document.getElementById('loginEmail').value;
    const password = document.getElementById('loginPassword').value;
    // Implement login logic here
    alert("Login successful for " + email);
}

function signup(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const name = document.getElementById('signupName').value;
    const email = document.getElementById('signupEmail').value;
    const password = document.getElementById('signupPassword').value;
    // Implement signup logic here
    alert("Signup successful for " + name + " with email " + email);
}
